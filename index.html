        <p> So I just want to take the time to tell you a little about myself and my journey. The good, bad, and the ugly.I have learned a lot through experience and making mistakes in life. There is so much that lead me to this point and I am grateful for it all. Anyway, I started developing a passion for programming and development a little bit after high school. 
       
           
        <p> Even though I wasn't around it much at the time, I went to college made an attempt at something I didn't like and like most people, I dropped out and quit. As much as I looked back to that time I am happy to say that it made me better and it helped me grow as a person. I was going through personal things then and didn't have the time really to be able to sit down and start coding. There were moments that I would sit and read through a whole book that was free or watching videos of others who were on the journey of becoming a Software Engineer/Developer and it inspired me to do the same.</p>
